# Nutrisync

This is a simple project implemented using Python tkinter and PIL.

## Description

This project is a web-based application that allows users to log in and sign up into the website

The project aims to develop a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator application coupled with exercise recommendations. Users input their height and weight into the BMI calculator, which then calculates their BMI and provides a corresponding health classification (underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese). Additionally, based on the BMI result, the application suggests personalized exercise recommendations to promote healthy weight management.

The project integrates both BMI calculation and exercise guidance to encourage users to adopt a balanced approach to health and fitness, promoting awareness of BMI and providing practical steps towards achieving and maintaining a healthy weight through exercise.
